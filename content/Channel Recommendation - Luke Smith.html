I've really been enjoying a youtuber recently called Luke Smith. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA">His channel</a>'s topics include suckless and Free software; philosophical rants; and neat things you can do with software to improve your tech habits. I'd check him out if I were you!
