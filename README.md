# Another take at a personal website.
This is the source to my personal website. I made it in a few days.

## Written In
- html
- css
- php

## Hosted On
- nginx
- php
- mariadb
- certbot

## Where is it?
www.andrewlovick.com

## Can I add a content page?
I've replaced content pages with an SQL implementation. Currently I'm not accepting new users but send me a DM and I'll be sure to read it!

## What's the plan for the SQL database?
Please see this ERD for design.

## Why no javascript?
Isn't it nicer like this?
