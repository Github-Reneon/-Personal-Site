# Another take at a personal website.
This is the source to my personal website. I made it in a day.

## Writen In
- html
- css
- php

## Hosted On
- nginx
- php
- certbot

## Where is it?
www.andrewlovick.com

## Can I add a content page?
Sure send a pull request. Just make sure to sign the end of the content with your name, and that it is a html or txt file. PHP is supported but I will not accept PHP pages from people I don't know.

## Why no javascript?
Isn't it nicer like this? :)
